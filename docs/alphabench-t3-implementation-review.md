# AlphaBench T3 implementation review

Implementation base: `56dd03f2a62ca888a5505e49014b86629ad47554`.
Branch: `codex/alphabench-t3-implementation`. All execution takes place on the
designated remote host under `/mnt/data1/Large-Discovery-Models/`.

## Change 1: durable shared selection lifecycle

Cross-check against the complete T3 plan: W02, X05–X06 and Y05. The engine stores
the entire selected batch, candidate payloads, selection metadata and schema
before preparation or dispatch. Recovery processes this batch before budget
exhaustion checks or another proposal/policy call. Stored results precede
idempotent evaluation events and checkpoints. An ambiguous dispatch without a
matching task receipt pauses; it cannot become a scored failed candidate.
New selections always clamp to all remaining attempt limits. The Host-owned
effective batch context cannot be overridden by the caller.

Complexity review: removed the old paid-prefix-only recovery path and its
separate pending-candidate machinery. Fresh and recovered selections share one
execution function. Removed tests that required repeating proposals or implicitly
resending an evaluation after interruption; retained the budget boundary tests
and added end-to-end crash boundary coverage. No second runtime or checkpoint
migration path was added. Manifest discovery permits newly registered tasks.

Validation: 87 targeted engine/campaign/reporting tests and the shared suite
(486 passed, 1 skipped) passed on the remote host using its locked environment.
This review does not qualify any market, backend or T3 method.
